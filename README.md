Version control is a good thing.

activeEdit.coffee and activeEdit.js are the original CS and its associated JS.

index.html and main.css are skeleton files that I used for testing.

test.js tests all the functionality of the Utility Class, though I had to mock some of the methods called within those methods.

u.coffee and u.js have the original CS and its associated JS for only the Utility Class.

utilities.ts and utilities.js are the translated TS and its associated JS for only the Utility Class.

utilities.doc is the documentation for the Utility class.
